# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
This goal of this project is to leverage python to audit and certify the election results for the Colorado Board of Elections. The raw election results were provided as a CSV file which can be read into Python for further analysis. The primary calculations are total votes, county-level votes/percentage breakdown, and certification of election winner. The Python script is designed to read the raw CSV file, perform calculations, and automatically generate a text file with the results.
